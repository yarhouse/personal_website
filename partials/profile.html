      <p>I've been in love with web design since our family got its first computer in 2000 <small>(my then-step-father was a serious technophobe)</small>. Playing with css and html elements on angelfire or geocities websites was my hobby after school or work, often helping my friends garage bands create their first websites or styling profile pages on the next social media website.</p>
      <p>I spent much of my 20's as a <abbr class="details" tooltip="glaÂ·zier (noun); a person whose profession is fitting glass into windows and doors.">glazier</abbr>, going from one bankrupt shop to the next. After being laid off from a 3rd shop in 2011, I realized my life in construction was going nowhere.<br />With encoragement from friends and family, I took the next year and dedicated myself to learning about UI design and OOP; ruby on rails, responsive css, jquery, rdbms. I had an amazing support system around me as well, and practiced alongside skilled programmers doing exactly what I wanted to achieve.</p>
